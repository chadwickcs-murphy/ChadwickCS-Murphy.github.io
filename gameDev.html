        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>We have all played and enjoyed games, but how do people actually design them? How do you describe a game? What are the basic elements? What about prototyping and iterating? How do we use the power of coding/programming to create an experience for the player? This course explores these questions and others. No previous programming experience is required.</p>
