        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>The highly motivated students that take this advanced course gain a deeper understanding of the end-to-end process of developing software while executing independent projects in the domain of their choosing. This course also explores a range of fundamental Computer Science topics to help prepare them for further studies in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>This course addresses three tracks in parallel: Software Engineering Topics, Core Computer Science Topics, and Independent Projects.</p>
        <h5>Software Engineering Topics</h5>
        <p>These are topics in Software Engineering that provide students a deeper understanding of the end-to-end process of developing software. These topics will enhance students’ ability to work with stakeholders and manage and deliver larger projects.</p>
        <p>Topics to include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>System Planning</li>
            <li>System Design</li>
            <li>Testing</li>
            <li>Project Management</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Core Computer Science Topics</h5>
        <p>These are topics in Computer Science that provide a solid foundation of knowledge for students. Covering this broad range of topics will prepare students for further studies in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>Topics to include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Binary Number Systems</li>
            <li>Binary Representation</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>Operating Systems</li>
            <li>Virtual Memory</li>
            <li>Compilers</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
            <li>Data Science</li>
            <li>Networking</li>
            <li>Web Architecture</li>
            <li>Control Systems</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Independent Projects</h5>
        <p>Students will propose and execute independent projects designed to advance their software engineering skills along with developing domain-specific knowledge.</p>
